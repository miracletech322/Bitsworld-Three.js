              <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
              <p><b>Last Updated: February, 1 2024</b></p>

              <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in BitsWorld INC (“BitsWorld,” “we,” or “us”) and our website at www.Bitsworld.IO, along with our related mobile games, mobile applications, websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and Bitsworld regarding your use of the Service.</p>
              <p>By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond this Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is subject to our Terms of Service.</p>

              <h4>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE,</h4>
              <p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BITSWORLD’ PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND BITSWORLD’ PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY BITSWORLD AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>

              <h4>Arbitration NOTICE.</h4>
              <p>Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 16, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND BITSWORLD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. (See Section 16.)</p>

              <h4>1. BITSWORLD Service Overview.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld is an online web, mobile gaming and application company.</p>

              <h4>2. Eligibility.</h4>
              <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Service only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms and any applicable additional terms. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

              <h4>3. Accounts and Registration.</h4>
              <p>To access certain features of the Service, you may be required to register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:support@bitsworld.io">support@bitsworld.io</a>.</p>

              <h4>4. General Payment Terms.</h4>
              <p>Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in local currency and are non-refundable.</p>

              <h4>4.1. Price.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Bitsworld may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Bitsworld gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Bitsworld, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Bitsworld customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>

              <h4>4.2. Authorization.</h4>
              <p>You authorize Bitsworld to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Bitsworld, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Bitsworld may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>

              <h4>4.3. Subscription Service.</h4>
              <p>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Bitsworld to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see the applicable mobile application or mobile application store. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by cancelling the subscription in the applicable application store, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

              <h4>4.4. Delinquent Accounts.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld may suspend or terminate access to the Service,
including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for
which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount
due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with
fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or
collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.</p>

              <h4>4.5. Virtual Items.</h4>
              <p>The Service may permit the purchase of virtual currency, goods,
items, or services that we expressly make available for use in the
Service ("Virtual Items"). You agree that any purchase of Virtual
Items grants you ownership within the confines of the Service,
and you are acquiring a limited license to use the Virtual Items
solely within the game environment, as further detailed in
Sections 5.1 and 6.2. You are only permitted to purchase Virtual
Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service, and
not through any other means. ALL PURCHASES AND
REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE
SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. Please note
that Virtual Items are intended for use solely within the Service
and do not possess any inherent monetary value. You may not
transfer, sell, or exchange Virtual Items outside of the Service's
ecosystem. Any unauthorized attempt to do so may result in the
termination of your account. We reserve the right to manage,
regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time,
with or without notice.</p>

              <h4>5. Licenses</h4>
              <h4>5.1. Limited License.</h4>
              <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these
Terms, Bitsworld grants you, solely for your personal, noncommercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, nonsub licensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object
code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service
obtained from a legitimate marketplace on a mobile device that
you own or control; (b) access and use the Service; and (c) use
Virtual Items in connection with your use of the Service.</p>

              <h4>5.2. License Restrictions.</h4>
              <p>Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible
under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute,
publicly display, or publicly perform the Service; (b) make
modifications to the Service; or (c) interfere with or circumvent
any feature of the Service, including any security or access
control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law
from using the Service, you may not use it.</p>

              <h4>5.3. Feedback.</h4>
              <p>If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding
problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the
Service (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant Bitsworld an
unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid,
royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for
any purpose, including to improve the Service and create other
products and services.</p>

              <h4>6. Ownership; Proprietary Rights.</h4>
              <h4>6.1. Service.</h4>
              <p>The Service is owned and operated by Bitsworld. The visual
interfaces, graphics, design, characters, gameplay, digital assets,
sounds, music, information, data, computer code (including
source code or object code), products, software, services, and all
other elements of the Service (“Materials”) provided by Bitsworld
are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All
Materials included in the Service are the property of Bitsworld or
its third party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by
Bitsworld, you may not make use of the Materials. Bitsworld
reserves all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in these
Terms.</p>

              <h4>6.2. Virtual Items.</h4>
              <p>Regardless of any other statement in these Terms, you
acknowledge and agree that you have ownership rights to the
Virtual Items you acquire in the game. These Virtual Items are
owned by you and are considered your property. However, you
understand and agree that the Virtual Items have no intrinsic
monetary value and do not constitute actual currency or property
of any type outside of the game's ecosystem. You may engage in
trading Virtual Items within the Service, including exchanging
them for the in-game currency provided by Bitsworld. However,
you may not transfer Virtual Items outside of the Service for
traditional currency or any other form of value, except as
explicitly permitted by Bitsworld. You may not sublicense, trade,
sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for traditional currency or
exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of the
Service, except as explicitly permitted by Bitsworld. Any
unauthorized transfer or attempted transfer of Virtual Items is
prohibited and may result in the termination of your Account.
Bitsworld reserves the right to manage, regulate, control, modify,
or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice.
Bitsworld will not be liable to you or any third party for any
consequences arising from exercising any such rights.
Additionally, we may, at our discretion and when deemed
appropriate, introduce mechanisms allowing for the trading of
Virtual Items outside of the Service's ecosystem. Any such
changes will be communicated to users in advance, and the
terms and conditions governing such external trading will be
clearly outlined.</p>

              <h4>7. Third Party Terms</h4>
              <h4>7.1. Third Party Services and Linked Websites.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld may provide tools through the Service that enable you
to export information, including User Content, to third party
services, including through features that allow you to link your
account on Bitsworld with an account on the third party service,
such as Twitter or Facebook, or through our implementation of
third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons). By using
one of these tools, you agree that Bitsworld may transfer that
information to the applicable third party service. Third party
services are not under Bitsworld’ control, and, to the fullest
extent
permitted by law, Bitsworld is not responsible for any third party
service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also
contain links to third party websites. Linked websites are not
under Bitsworld’ control, and Bitsworld is not responsible for
their
content.</p>

              <h4>7.2. Third Party Software.</h4>
              <p>The Service may include or incorporate third party software
components that are generally available free of charge under
licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and
distribute those components (“Third Party Components”).
Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms,
nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to
prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third Party Components
under the applicable third party licenses or to limit your use of
Third Party Components under those third party licenses.</p>

              <h4>8. User Content</h4>
              <h4>8.1. User Content Generally.</h4>
              <p>Certain features of the Service may permit users to upload

(“User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Service. You
retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may

transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of
formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole
or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels
now known or hereafter developed.</p>

              <h4>8.3. Limited License Grant to Other Users.</h4>
              <p>By providing User Content to or via the Service to other users of

and the functionality of the Service.</p>

              <h4>8.4. User Content Representations and
Warranties.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld disclaims any and all liability in connection with User
Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and
the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By
providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and
warrant that:
a. you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the
necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to
authorize Bitsworld and users of the Service to use and distribute
your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted
by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Bitsworld,
the Service, and these Terms;
b. your User Content, and the use of your User Content as

proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of
privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or
(iii) cause Bitsworld to violate any law or regulation; and

person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic,
harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise
inappropriate.</p>

              <h4>8.5. User Content Disclaimer.</h4>
              <p>We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that
you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way
responsible or liable for User Content. Bitsworld may, however, at
any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block
any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms
or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using
the Service you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of
sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate,
offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do
waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may
have against Bitsworld with respect to User Content. If notified
by
a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not
conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and
determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User
Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without
notice. For clarity, Bitsworld does not permit copyright-infringing
activities on the Service.</p>

              <h4>8..6. Monitoring Content.</h4>
              <p>Bitsworld does not control and does not have any obligation to
monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third
parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You
acknowledge and agree that Bitsworld reserves the right to, and
may from time to time, monitor any and all information
transmitted or received through the Service for operational and
other purposes. If at any time Bitsworld chooses to monitor the
content, Bitsworld still assumes no responsibility or liability for
content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of
content. During monitoring, information may be examined,
recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy
Policy.</p>

              <h4>16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h4>
              <h4>16.1. Generally.</h4>
              <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Bitsworld in
the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as
described in Section 16.2, you and Bitsworld agree that every
dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by
binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in
court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can
be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
the same damages and relief that a court can award. This
agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of
or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after
the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND
BITSWORLD
ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
</p>

              <h4>16.2. Exceptions.</h4>
              <p>Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms
will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of
either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court;
(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal,
state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive
relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a
court of law to address an intellectual property infringement
claim.</p>

              <h4>16.3. Arbitrator.</h4>
              <p>Any arbitration between you and Bitsworld will be settled under
the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration
Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The
AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="#">www.adr.org,</a>
by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting
Bitsworld. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or
enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement</p>

              <h4>16.4. Notice of Arbitration; Process.</h4>
              <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or
by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party
has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic
mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Bitsworld’ address for Notice is:
Bitsworld INC, 2005 Walnut St, Cary, NC 27518. The Notice of
Arbitration must: (a) describe the
nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good
faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not
reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of
Arbitration is received, you or Bitsworld may commence an
arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the
parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties
in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
offer made by you or Bitsworld must not be disclosed to the
arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and
award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than
the last written settlement amount offered by Bitsworld in
settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Bitsworld will pay to
you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii)
$5,000.</p>

              <h4>16.5. Fees.</h4>
              <p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms,
Bitsworld will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,
unless your claim is for more than $5,000, in which case the
payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any
arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon
in King County, Washington, but if the claim is for $5,000 or less,
you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a)
solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b)
through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an
in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county
(or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either
the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then
the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that
case, you agree to reimburse Bitsworld for all monies previously
disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under
the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written
decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>

              <h4>16.6. No Class Actions.</h4>
              <p>YOU AND BITSWORLD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
CLAIMS
AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Bitsworld agree otherwise, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims,
and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
or class proceeding.</p>

              <h4>16.7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</h4>
              <p>If Bitsworld makes any future change to this arbitration provision,
other than a change to Bitsworld’ address for Notice of
Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written
notice within 30 days of the change to Bitsworld’ address for
Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Bitsworld
will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>

              <h4>16.8. Enforceability.</h4>
              <p>If Section 16.6 is found to be
unenforceable or if the entirety of
this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties
agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in
Section 17.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to
these Terms.</p>

              <h4>17. Miscellaneous</h4>
              <h4>17.1. General Terms.</h4>
              <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other
agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these
Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
between you and Bitsworld regarding your use of the Service.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under
these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at
any time without notice or consent. The failure to require
performance of any provision will not affect our right to require
performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us
of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these
Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a
waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these
Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on
the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the
use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”.
If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent
possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and
effect.</p>

              <h4>17.2. Governing Law.</h4>
              <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of
North Carolina without regard to conflict of law principles. You
and Bitsworld submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
the state courts and federal courts located within Wake county,
North Carolina for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding
permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our
offices in North Carolina, and we make no representation that
Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for
use in other locations.</p>

reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>

receiving certain electronic
communications from us as further described in our Privacy
Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our
electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices,
